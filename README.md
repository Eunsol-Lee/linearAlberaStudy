# linearAlberaStudy
Linear Algebra Study with a friend.

Since Apirl 10, 2017, I've started to study linear algebra.

There are several reasons for study this.

First of all, basically, math skills are lacking. I had learned math for the last time in university. However, the school I attended was medical school, so I studied only the basic calculus. So I had to feel that there was always a shortage in dealing with something related engineering.
Second, I plan to study algorithms, statistics, and machine learning (especially deep learning) in the future. but I realized that I would not be able to study them unless I had good mathematics skills. So I start this study.

My friend [Cha Minkyoo](https://github.com/cl9200) and I decided to study while listening to the lecture below. The book was ordered from the bookstore, too. I plan to listen to about two lectures a week. I will try to summarize the contents little by little as I study.

- Linear algebra: to solve a system of linear equations
- Row picture
  - Picture of one equation(row) at a time
 Â - *One row becomes the base unit when actually drawing the graph*
- ** Column picture **
  - Picture of a column at a time
  - Linear combination of the columns
- Matrix form
  - Using a matrix called A
- AX = b (the matrix of coefficients x a vector of unknowns = right-hand side a v ector)
